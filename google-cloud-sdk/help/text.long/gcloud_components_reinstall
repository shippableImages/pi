         components you have now

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud components reinstall [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      fix it by downloading the latest version of the Cloud SDK and reinstalling
      it. This will replace your existing installation with a fresh one. The
      command is the equivalent of deleting your current installation,
      downloading a fresh copy of the SDK, and installing in the same location.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK core component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
