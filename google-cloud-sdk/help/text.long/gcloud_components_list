        up to date), and update available (installed, but not up to date)

      o ID of the component (used to refer to the component in other
        [gcloud components] commands)
      o Size of the component

      In addition, if the --show-versions flag is specified, the command lists
      the currently installed version (if any) and the latest available version
      of each individual component.
