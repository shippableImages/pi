NAME

      gcloud components remove - remove one or more installed components

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud components remove COMPONENT-ID [COMPONENT-ID ...] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      Uninstall all listed components, as well as all components that directly
      or indirectly depend on them. For example, if the component
      unicorn-factory depends on the component horn-factory, removing
      horn-factory will cause unicorn-factory to be removed as well. The command
      lists all components it is about to remove, and asks for confirmation
      before proceeding.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      COMPONENT-ID [COMPONENT-ID ...]

         The IDs of the components to be removed.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

EXAMPLES

      To remove COMPONENT-1, COMPONENT-2, and all components that directly or
      indirectly depend on COMPONENT-1 or COMPONENT-2, type the following:

        $ gcloud components remove COMPONENT-1 COMPONENT-2

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK core component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
