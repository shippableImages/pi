NAME

      gcloud config set - edit Google Cloud SDK properties

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud config set SECTION/PROPERTY VALUE [--scope SCOPE] [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      Set the value for an option, so that Cloud SDK tools can use them as
      configuration.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      SECTION/PROPERTY

         The property to be set. Note that SECTION/ is optional while referring
         to properties in the core section.

      VALUE

         The value to be set.

FLAGS

      --scope SCOPE

         The scope flag determines which configuration file is modified by this
         operation. The files are read (and take precedence) in the following
         order:

         workspace

            The workspace based configuration file is based on your current
            working directory. You can set project specific configuration here
            that will only take effect when working within that project's
            directory. You cannot set this value if you are not currently within
            a gcloud workspace. This will override all values from any other
            configuration files.

         user

            The user based configuration file applies only to the current user
            of the system. It will override any values from the installation
            configuration.

         installation

            The installation based configuration file applies to all users on
            the system that use this version of the Cloud SDK. If the SDK was
            installed by an administrator, you will need administrator rights to
            make changes to this file.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

EXAMPLES

      To set the project property in the core section, run:

        $ gcloud config set project myProject

      To set the zone property in the compute section, run:

        $ gcloud config set compute/zone zone3

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK core component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
