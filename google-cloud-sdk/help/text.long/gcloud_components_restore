NAME

      gcloud components restore - restore the Cloud SDK installation to its
         previous state

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud components restore [GLOBAL-FLAG ...]

DESCRIPTION

      This is an undo operation, which restores the Cloud SDK installation on
      the local workstation to the state it was in just before the most recent
      gcloud components update or gcloud components remove command. Only the
      state before the most recent such state is remembered, so it is impossible
      to restore the state that existed before the two most recent update
      commands, for example. A restore command does not undo a previous restore
      command.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      Run $ gcloud help for a description of flags available to all commands.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK core component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
