The scope flag determines which configuration file is modified by this operation\&. The files are read (and take precedence) in the following order:
.PP
\fBworkspace\fR
.RS 4
The workspace based configuration file is based on your current working directory\&. You can set project specific configuration here that will only take effect when working within that project\(cqs directory\&. You cannot set this value if you are not currently within a gcloud workspace\&. This will override all values from any other configuration files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBuser\fR
.RS 4
The user based configuration file applies only to the current user of the system\&. It will override any values from the installation configuration\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBinstallation\fR
.RS 4
The installation based configuration file applies to all users on the system that use this version of the Cloud SDK\&. If the SDK was installed by an administrator, you will need administrator rights to make changes to this file\&.
